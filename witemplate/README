This is a dissertation template for UW Madison. It builds on
memoir.cls (which you'll need to have installed) and on the 
(venerable but subtly-broken) withesis.cls.  You'll want to 
process your document with pdflatex; you'll want the following 
packages installed (somewhere in your TEXINPUTS) as well:

* natbib
* microtype
* booktabs
* enumitem
* theorem
* svn-multi

The following packages are used by default, but you can comment
them out if you don't need/want them:

* amssymb
* amsmath
* hyperref
* mathpartir

I suggest making one subdirectory for each chapter, and putting
the .tex file and all of the figures for that chapter there.
Then, simply \include each chapter in dissertation.tex.

Other files of interest include:

 * mcbride.bst:  this is included for convenience; if you 
   have a later version, just delete this one

 * backmatter/colophon.tex: if you're a big nerd and want to tell
   everyone the excruciating details of your typesetting
   adventures, this is the place.

 * frontmatter/abstract.tex:  your abstract goes here

 * frontmatter/acks.tex:  your acknowledgements go here

 * frontmatter/frontmatter.tex: sets up the main structure for
   the front matter of your diss

 * includes/defs.tex: your commands/environments; includes one
   for epigraphs at the beginning of chapters and one for
   per-file SVN info

 * includes/preamble.tex: this is where you want to set up your
   chapter style (see the excellent memoir class documentation on
   CTAN) and include any other packages you need

 * includes/thesisdefs.tex: some definitions from the withesis
   document class

This template is basically unsupported, but you should feel free to
email me questions -- just know that I might not be able to deliver
a timely or useful reply.  (On the other hand, I absolutely welcome
patches that provide fixes or functionality enhancements.)

Good luck!
